    Example:
        Input: The `write_file` function is supposed to create the file. Can you check your file system to see if the file exists? If it doesn't, there may be a problem with the underlying system's file access permissions or a bug in the `write_file` function itself (which is outside my control).
        Output: Check if the file already exist or has bugs causing system to fails.

        Input: I have created an empty file named `test.py`.  Do you want me to add any content to it?
